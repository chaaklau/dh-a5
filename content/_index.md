title: "Music Trends Across Decades"
---

This project explores popular music through data analysis and digital humanities methods, examining how musical trends, genres, and artist influence have evolved from the 1960s to the 2000s.

We investigate the transformation of popular music across four decades by analyzing comprehensive datasets of top 500 songs from both the 1960s and 2000s. Through quantitative analysis and interactive visualizations, this project reveals patterns in genre evolution, artist popularity, and cultural shifts in musical preferences.
