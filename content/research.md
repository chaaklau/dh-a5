**How have musical genres, artist popularity, and listening patterns evolved between the 1960s and 2000s, and what do these changes reveal about cultural shifts in popular music consumption?**

This research investigates:

1. **Genre Evolution** - Which genres dominated each era and how prevalence changed over four decades
2. **Artist Influence** - How artist-genre relationships differ between time periods and which artists bridge multiple genres
3. **Popularity Metrics** - Patterns in view counts and engagement metrics across both decades

Understanding these patterns provides insight into cultural and social changes reflected through music, evolution of industry trends, how digital technology influenced music discovery, and the relationship between genre classification and listener preferences.
