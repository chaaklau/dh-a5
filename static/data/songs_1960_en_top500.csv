He acts the way he thinks she should

I'll play this game his way

I'll cling on steadfastly

I'll love him, right or wrong
And, somehow, I'll be strong

The Hippopotamus Song,pop,Flanders & Swann,1960,41548,"{""Donald Swann"",""Michael Flanders""}","[Verse 1]
[FLANDERS & SWANN]
A bold hippopotamus was standing one day
On the banks of the cool Shalimar
He gazed at the bottom, as it peacefully lay
By the light of the evening star
Away on a hilltop sat combing her hair
His fair hippopotami maid
The hippopotamus was no ignoramus
And sang her this sweet serenade

[Chorus]
Mud, mud, glorious mud
Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood
So follow me, follow
Down to the hollow
And there let us wallow in glorious mud

[Verse 2]
The fair hippopotama he aimed to entice
From her seat on that hilltop above
As she hadn't got a ma to give her advice
Came tip-toeing down to her love
Like thunder the forest re-echoed the sound
Of the song that they sang as they met
His inamorata adjusted her garter
And lifted her voice in duet
[FLANDERS]
Falsetto!

[Chorus]
[FLANDERS & SWANN]
Mud, mud, glorious mud
Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood
So follow me, follow
Down to the hollow
And there let us wallow in glorious mud

Now more hippopotami began to convene
On the banks of that river so wide
I wonder now what-am-I to say of the scene
That ensued by the Shalimar side?
They dived all at once with an ear-splitting splosh
Then rose to the surface again
A regular army of hippopotarmy
All singing this haunting refrain

Now's yer chance!

Let your arms invite me

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two
With George Pratt his partner, and brother Billy too

Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome

Sam crossed the majestic mountains
To the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow

Ballad of the Alamo,country,Marty Robbins,1960,14765,{},"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins
That the weeds have overgrown

You may look in vain for crosses
And you'll never see a one
But sometimes between the setting
And the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marchin' by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett
And a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free
Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo

""You may never see your loved ones""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay""

In the sand he drew the line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line

With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancin'
On a horse that was black as the night

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousin' rebel yell

Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play degüello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Everyone will be put to the sword!""
One hundred and eighty five
Holdin' back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again

Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were comin'
Never came, never came, never came

Twice he charged then blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed them, one and all

Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers
Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord

In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto
Rides a cowboy all alone

And he sees the cattle grazin'
Where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazin'
And the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly
To the men of Alamo

To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo",2141046,en,en,en

Shall two knights never tilt for me

Worshipped and competed for?

The craziest flower that grows

Behind my mantilla I will pose
The beauty that nobody knows
So regal and cool, exciting and cruel
That's me, Spanish rose

Me name Rosita Hernandez

You like me, yes? No? Maybe? ""Eeyuckh!""

To cross Spanish rose isn't wise

So don't mess around
Her heart she cold like ice

With Albert I will dance to the bolero
We'll cha cha in the nicest honky tonks
He'll wear the cutest mustache and sombrero

Where all men are brothers
Where all things are bound by law

To view his collection of stamps;
And he said as he hastened to put out the cat
The wine, his cigar, and the lamps:

You shouldn't drink spirits at this time of night

Do finish it up, it will help you to sleep

Crash! Tinkle! it fell to the floor

Up her mind, and a dash for the door —

As she paused to take breath in the cool midnight air

With a smile on her lips and an ache in her head
And a beard in her earhole that tickled and said:

And smile a woman's smile

Cried alack and alas for thee

Put the gold in her hair

I started on a journey about a year ago
To a little town called Morrow in the state of Ohio
I've never been much of a traveler, and I really didn't know
That Morrow was the hardest place I'd ever try to go

[Verse 2]
So I went down to the station for my ticket and applied
For tips regarding Morrow, not expecting to be guyed
Said I, ""My friend, I'd like to go to Morrow and return
No later than tomorrow, for I haven't time to burn""

[Verse 3]
Said he to me, ""Now let me see if I have heard you right
You'd like to go to Morrow and return tomorrow night
You should have gone to Morrow yesterday and back today
For the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way

[Verse 4]
If you had gone to Morrow yesterday now don't you see
You could have gone to Morrow and returned today at three
For the train today to Morrow, if the schedule is right
Today it goes to Morrow and returns tomorrow night""
[Verse 5]
Said I, ""My friend, it seems to me you're talkin' through your hat
There is a town named Morrow on the line now tell me that""
""There is,"" said he, ""but take from me a quiet little tip
To go from here to Morrow is a 14-hour trip""

[Verse 6]
""The train today to Morrow leaves today at 8:35
At half-past ten tomorrow is the time it should arrive
So if from here to Morrow is a 14-hour jump
Can you go today to Morrow and get back today, you chump?""

Said I, ""I'd like to go to Morrow, so can I go today
And get to Morrow by tonight if there is no delay?""
""Well, well,"" said he to me, ""and I've got no more to say
Can't get anywhere tomorrow and get back again today""

[Verse 8]
Said I, ""I guess you know it all, but kindly let me say
How can I get to Morrow if I leave this town today?""
Said he, ""You cannot go to Morrow any more today
'Cause the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way""

I was so disappointed, I was mad enough to swear
The train had gone to Morrow and had left me standing there

Paddy And The Whale
PADDY AND THE WHALE

Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee;
He had a strong notion old England to see;
He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound
And the whiskey he drank made his head go around

Cho: Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee *

O, Paddy been never sailing before;
It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar;
For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
""I'm going to be ate,"" says Paddy,""by-and-by""

O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip
Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip
He was down in the whale six months and five days
Till luck one day to his throat he did pop
The whale give a snort and then give a blow
And out on the land poor Paddy did go

O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore;
He swears that he 'll never go to sea any more
The next time he wishes old England to see
It will be when the railroad runs over the sea

What Do the Simple Folk Do?,pop,Frederick Loewe,1960,3573,"{""Julie Andrews"",""Richard Burton""}","[GUENEVERE]
What do the simple folk do
To help them escape when they're blue?
The shepard who is ailing, the milkmaid who is glum
The cobbler who is wailing from nailing his thumb
When they're beset and besieged
The folk not noblessly obliged
However do they manage to shed their weary lot?
Oh, what do simple folk do we do not?

[ARTHUR]
I have been informed by those who know them well
They find relief in quite a clever way
When they're sorely pressed, they whistle for a spell
And whistling seems to brighten up their day
And that's what simple folk do
So they say

[GUENEVERE]
They whistle?
[ARTHUR]
So they say

[GUENEVERE]
What else do the simple folk do
To pluck up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro
Have ways known to their own folk
We throne folk don't know
When all the doldrums begin
What keeps each of them in his skin?
What ancient native custom provides the needed glow?
Oh, what do simple folk do?
Do you know?

[ARTHUR]
Once, upon the road, I came upon a lad
Singing in a voice three times his size
When I asked him why, he told me he was sad
And singing always made his spirits rise

And daffodils blossom away
Hear Venus call to one and all
And taste delight while you may
The world is bright and all is right
And life is merry and gay

What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two
They obviously outshine us at turning tears to mirth
And tricks a royal highness is minus from birth
What, then, I wonder, do they
To chase all the goblins away?
They have some tribal sorcery you haven't mentioned yet
Oh, what do simple folk do to forget?

[ARTHUR]
Often, I am told, they dance a fiery dance
And whirl till they're completely uncontrolled
Soon the mind is blank and oh, they're in a trance
A violent trance astounding to behold

But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy come there

And I was a skinny kid about sixteen
And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp
None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first
But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job
A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen
That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said
Mister, I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was
Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it
Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber
I didn't know what a high climber was, boy, I sure learned fast
That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe
I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it
It wasn't long 'til I learned that a man's got to be a lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin'
Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them

Want to leave this town

Soldier's Field and Marshall Field
And it's on a nice lake

The hansoms in the park
It hasn't got a skyline after dark

Hollywood's got movie stars and
Movie czars and cocktail bars and
Shiny cars and a wonderful climate, they say

Keep your California

Lots of people like St.Louis
It's got lots of shoes
And the St.Louis blues and
One of our larger rivers runs by

It hasn't got a famous string quartet

As home through the shadows they wander
Everyone smiling in secret delight
They stare at the castle and ponder
Whenever the wind blows this way
You can almost hear everyone say

I wonder what the king is doing tonight?
What merriment is the king pursuing tonight?
The candles at the court, they never burned as bright
I wonder what the king is up to tonight?
How goes the final hour as he sees the bridal bower
Being regally and legally prepared?
Well, I'll tell you what the king is doing tonight
He's scared, he's scared

You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Hacked him in two and fixed his wagon
Goes to be wed in terror and distress? Yes
A warrior who's so calm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle
Faces a woman petrified with fright? Right
You mean that appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering
Is merely the banging of his royal knees? Please
You wonder what the king is wishing tonight?
He's wishing he were in Scotland fishing tonight
What occupies his time while waiting for the bride?
He's searching high and low for some place to hide
And oh, the expectation, the sublime anticipation
He must feel about the wedding night to come

He was by the waterhole

A thousand dollar prize it read

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do that cannot wait

He was the youngest driver there
The crowd roared as they started the race
'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace

No one knows what happened that day
How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath, they heard him say
Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

And in the chapel where Laura prays
For her Tommy who passed away

Frosty the Snowman,pop,Ella Fitzgerald,1960,1646,{},"Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump

I rode one day to the cowtown of San Angelo
A hot sun was glowing, a hot breeze was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss

She sent a message a long time ago
Secora had promised to meet me in San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl

I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few minutes more and she'll be at my side

At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Secora, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet
But something is wrong with our plans and I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street
Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see

Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Secora, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street

""Up on your horse"", she is crying
""Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for you""
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone
For a bullet is well on its way and it finds my Secora
She cries as she falls in my arms

Over and over her soft lips did say
""Now we're together, I won't let them take you away""
One little sigh, her little lips tremble
Then it was over, Secora had drifted away

Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I rise to meet him, my one thought it beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die
I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to die
Their bullets are coming my way, how they hurt when they hit me
The pain makes me fall to the ground

Gone is my strength, just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life
If I must die, let me find Secora
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left

Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the pain

The ladies wore their brightest shawls
The gentlemen were gay
They came to see their Yankee boys WHIP old Virginia
I held my momma's hand and skipped
When a soldier said to me
Would you rather have Jeff Davis' hat or the sword of Bobbie Lee

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

And then the general doffed his hat and said let's rest a spell
And for the first time we all heard that awful rebel yell
The waters of Manasas Creek became a ruby red
And many a Reb and Yankee boy lay in the willows dead

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

A fight locked in the chest of time too horrible to tell
Virginny's true green countryside became a lake of hell
Don't count your chicks before they're hatched
Or you'll work until it's done

Pinball Machine,country,Lonnie Irving,1960,1448,{},"[Spoken Intro]
This story's about an ex-truck driver bein' named John James Wall before his friends blackballed him and nick-named him Pinball. I gathered this story from a truck stop in Gallipolis, Ohio when this old feller, I'd say, 70 years old asked me to buy him a strong cup of coffee and a piece of good apple pie

I bought the coffee and the pie for the old feller and I'm awful glad I did because he winked his eye and smiled and said ""My!, My!"" Then I noticed in a few minutes, with trembling hands he pushed a part of his pie and coffee back and looked at me with tears running down his poor old weather-beaten cheek, and this is what he said...

I'm an old hog-hauler, I drove a big truck
I shot the pinball machine, but it caused me bad luck
But all I ever made in a pinball machine
I'd get four catty-corners, then I'd miss the 16
I wish they'd outlaw them old pinball machines
Many weeks they have caused me to live on sardines

Last time I called my wife on the phone
The first thing she says, ""John, when can you come home?""
""I've got a load of hogs and they've got to go
I'll see you when I get back from Chicago.""
She says, ""John, you know I love you, I wish you wouldn't go
Send your babies some money, they are hungry and cold""
The last thing she said and then she hung up
""John, you give up my lovin', just to drive an old truck""
I made my trip on to Chicago
I was gone two months, 'cause I shot up my dough
When I got home my family was gone
The best friend I had, rung my telephone
He says, ""John, I guess you wonder about your babies and wife?
Pneumonia got your babies and your wife took her life""
I lost all my friends, I can't sleep for bad dreams
I dream about an old truck and a pinball machine

[Spoken Outro]
I never will forget the last words that old man said
""Oh! Lord, if I could live my life over!"" and then he fell dead

Somethin' far away was spellin' trouble in the sky
Comin' closer was a sound that topped the devil's choir
Then we knew we had to race a raging prairie fire

When all at once a flame is seen a lickin' at the sky

We'd just one chance to get away for there's no place to hide
Gotta reach the river Platte one inch deep and one mile wide

The herd is gettin' tired but we've got no time to rest
I try to clear the red dust that is gatherin' in my chest
From ridin' tail on a thousand head with the weather gettin' dry
The black cloud in the west is warning ride ride ride

The roarin' heat is closer ashes fallin' by our side
And every breeze is burnin' singin' with its warnin' cry
We've got to reach the river but it's still ten miles or more
And close behind us we can hear that wind infernal roar
But fate had other plans for we lost that fatal race
We lost for neither man nor beast could long keep up the pace
The mighty Platte subdued its rage but none were there to rest
We did our best to get away but only I am left

Now on the blackened prairie far as the eye can see
The grim remains are there to show that God rules you and me
Just one he left to tell the tale just one was his desire

Cut Across Shorty,pop,Eddie Cochran,1960,1369,{},"Now a country boy called Shorty
And a city boy named Dan
Had to prove who could run the fastest
To win Miss Lucy’s hand

And he also had the looks
But Shorty musta had that something, boys
That can’t be found in books

Well, ""Cut across, Shorty, Shorty, cut across""
That's what Miss Lucy said
""Cut across, Shorty, Shorty, cut across
It's you that I wanna wed'

Now Dan had been in training
About a week before the race
He made up his mind old Shorty
Would end in second place
And Dan with his long legs a-flying
Left Shorty far behind
And Shorty heard him holler out
""Miss Lucy, you’ll soon be mine""
Oh well, ""Cut across, Shorty, Shorty, cut across""
That's what Miss Lucy said
""Cut across, Shorty, Shorty, cut across

There was a smile upon his face
He knew that he was a-going to win
'Cause Lucy had fixed the race
And just like that old story
About the turtle and the hare
When Danny crossed over the finish line
He found Shorty waiting there

Oh well, ""Cut across, Shorty, shorty, cut across""

He started his long ride in Prescott
The sun was a hundred or more
On down he rode at full gallop
Into the flat desert floor

Driving the big herd to Flagstaff
In Prescott the letter was there
Happiness soon would be sorrow
Sad news the letter did bear

Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't go too slow
Ride, cowboy, ride
You've a long way to go

Racked by fever and pain
Reaching for you at her bedside
At each breath she's callin' your name
Forward he leaned in the saddle
Pushing through mesquite and sage
His head never raised for a greeting
As he passed the Wickenburg stage

Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way to go

In Phoenix he traded horses
Now on the back of this roan
He could see visions of Tucson
His darlin' and their lovely home

Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
There's still a hundred and twenty to go

In through the ranch gate he galloped
And without breaking his stride
He bounded out of the saddle
And rushed to his sweet darlin's side

Then as the dyin' girl saw him
A smile came over her face
Holding her hand as it tightened
Barely had he won the race

She gets too hungry for dinner at eight
Hates the theater but never comes late
She never bothers with the people she hates
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp

Don't go to crap games with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermines and pearls
She won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care, she's broke and that's okay
Hates California, so smarty and damp

She gets massages, she cries and she moans
Tells Slenderella, just to leave her alone
She's not so hot but her shape is her own
That's why, that's why the lady is a tramp

But she doesn't know what motels are about
She puts in a dime and some ice comes out

Diamonds and lace, no God, so what?
For Rod Steiger, she whistles and stamps
That's why the lady is a tramp now

She don't like fly-'em-up but I'm glad I'm alive
I crave affection baby but not when I drive

I missed the crowning but I didn't mind
She won't play ""Scarlet"" and ""Gone With The Wind""

I like to hang her hat wherever I please
And fly with a breeze and no dough, hi ho
She thinks that Marciano was still a great, big champ
That's why the lady is a tramp now
She goes down to Coney and she thinks the beach is divine
She goes to the ballgames and thinks the Yankees are fine
Why she reads Walther Winchell and understands every line
That's why the lady is a tramp now

She likes to go rowing down Central Park lake
She digs a price fight that isn't a fake
Why she even goes to the opera and stays wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp now

Now what can I lose? She's flat and that's that

Transfusion Blues,country,Johnny Cash,1960,824,{},"[Verse]
Early one morning while making the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joint, taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down""

Said, ""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just read it to me""
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried-up carcass in that county jail

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by 12 honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read ""in the first degree""
I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me!""

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come all you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be",321840,en,en,en

Their main concern at the moment is trying to stay out of the United States Army, ha ha ha ha ha—a problem which I have long since not had to care about.

They'll use a man for his money when its gone they'll turn him down
They're all alike at the bottom selfish and grasping for all
They'll stay by a man when he's winning and laugh in his face when he falls
My pal was an honest young puncher honest and upright and true
Till he turned to a gunshooting gambler on account of a girl named Lou
They fell in with evil companions the kind they are better off dead
When a gambler insulted her picture he filled him full of lead
All through the long night they trailed him through mesquite and thick chaparral
I couldn't help think of that woman as I saw him pitch and fall
If she'd been the pal that she should have he might have been rising a son
Instead of out there in the prairie to die by a ranger's gun
Death's sharp sting did not trouble his chances for life were too slim
Where they were putting his body was all that worried him
He lifted his head on his elbow the blood from his wound flowed red
He gazed at his friends gathered round him he looked up at them and he said
Bury me out on the prairie where the coyotes can howl o'er my grave
Bury me out on the prairie but from them my bones please save
Wrap me up in a blanket bury me deep in the ground
Cover me over the boulders of granite big and round
We buried him on the prairie where the coyotes can howl o'er his grave

And many another young puncher as he rides past the pile of stones

Why Dont You Love Me Like You Used to Do?,country,George Jones,1960,755,{},"(Hank Williams, Sr.)

So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Can't have no lovin' like a huggin'
And a kissin' in a long, long while

Or closer than a country mile
Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothin' like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Until he made the headsman bob her hair
Ah, yes, he did her wrong long years ago
And she comes up at night to tell him so

She walks the bloody tower
With her head tucked underneath her arm

She comes to haunt King Henry, she means giving him what for
Gadzooks, she's going to tell him off, she's feeling very sore
And just in case the headsman wants to give her an encore
She has her head tucked underneath her arm

With her head tucked underneath her arm

And when they had a few they shout, ""Is Army going to win?""
They think it's Red Grange instead of poor old Ann Boleyn

Sometimes gay King Henry gives a spread
For all his pals and gals and ghostly crew
The headsman craves the joint and cuts the bread
Then in comes Anne Boleyn to queer the do
She holds her head up with a wild ""Wah-hoo!""
And Henry cries, ""Don't drop it in the soup!""

Guantanamo City has hundreds of doors
And everyone's jammed with hundreds of whores
They hang from the windows with stark naked chests
And knock out your brains with their low-hanging breasts

Well, the boys in my outfit are workin' a plan
We're savin' each nickel and dollar we can
And we'll buy T.N.T. and one sunshiny day
We'll blow up this goddamned Guantanamo Bay",3610760,en,en,en

The Ballad of Sigmund Freud,pop,The Chad Mitchell Trio,1960,698,{},"Well, it started in Vienna not so many years ago
When not enough folks were getting sick
That a starving young physician tried to better his position
By discovering what made his patients tick

He forgot about sclerosis and invented the psychosis
And a hundred ways that sex could be enjoyed
He adopted as his credo, ""Down repression, up libido!""
And that was the start of Doctor Sigmund Freud

Well, Doctor Freud (Doctor Freud), oh Doctor Freud (Doctor Freud)
How we wish you had been differently employed!
But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud

Well, he analyzed the dreams of the teens and libertines
Substituted monologue for pills
He drew crowds just like Will Sadler, when along came Jung and Adler
And they said, ""By God, there's gold in them thar ills!""

They encountered no resistance when they served as Freud's assistants
As with ego and with id they deftly toyed
But instead of toting bedpans, they wore analytic deadpans
Those ambitious doctors Adler, Jung, and Freud!
Well, Doctor Freud, (Doctor Freud), goes marching in (goes marching in?)
How we wish you had been differently employed!
But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud

Now the big three have departed, but not so the cult they started
No, it's being carried on by a goodly band
And to trauma, shock, and war shock, someone's gone and added Rorschach
And the thing has got completely out of hand!

So old boys with double chinsies, and a thousand would-be Kinseys
They discuss it at the drop of a repression
And I wouldn't be complaining, but for all the loot I'm paying
Just to lie on someone's couch and say confession?

Well, Doctor Freud (cha cha cha), oh Doctor Freud (cha cha cha)
How we wish you had been differently employed!
But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud

(Soft)
But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
(That was beautiful, fellas)
Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud, cha cha cha",5142920,en,en,en

When I first met the lil' girl

My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You,country,Johnny Cash,1960,686,{},"[Verse 1]

My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you

Settin the Woods on Fire,country,George Jones,1960,685,{},"Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're settin' the woods on fire

You're my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock of yeller
I'll look swell, but you'll look sweller
Settin' the woods on fire

We'll take in all the honkey tonks
Tonight we're having fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done

I don't care who thinks we're silly
You be Daffy and I'll be Dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chili
Settin' the woods on fire

I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke, but I'll be broker
Tonight, we're settin' the woods on fire
We'll set close to one another
Up one street and down the other
We'll have a time, oh brother
Settin' the woods on fire

We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doing fine
But the air is showing through

You clap hands and I'll start bowing
We'll do all the law's allowing
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowing

Down With Love,pop,Judy Garland,1960,685,{},"You sons of Adam, you daughters of Eve
The time has come to take
Your love-torn hearts off your sleeve
Look, look about you
What, what do you see?
Love-sick, love-lorn, love-wrecked, love-worn
Boo hoomanity
They'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe
Are we mice or are we men?
Can't you see the light?
Come you fellow victims lets unite

Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that mood and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love, let's liquidate all its friends
Like moons, Junes, roses and rainbows ends
Down with songs that moan about night and day
Down with love, just take it away, away
Take it away, Take it away
Give it back to the birds, and the bees and the Viennese
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid
Down with signs, down with Cupid
Ruttle that stuff that duff
Down with love

Down with love
