Stand by Me,rb,Ben E. King,1960,1590384,{},"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me

[Verse 2]
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[Chorus]
And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by me",72156,en,en,en

Georgia
The whole day through
(The whole day through)
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
